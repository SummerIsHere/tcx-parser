# tcx-parser
Parse .tcx files exported from Polar Flow into a tidy data table for export as a .csv file

## Usage
The easiest way is to copy the parse_tcx.py file into a folder containing your .tcx files, then calling "python parse_tcx.py" in that folder. The resulting .csv file will be named "output.csv"

Type "python parse_tcx.py --help" for more details on how to use arguments.
